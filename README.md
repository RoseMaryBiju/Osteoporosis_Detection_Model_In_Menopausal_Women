# Osteoporosis_Detection_Model_In_Menopausal_Women
1. Data Preparation:

Mounting Google Drive: The code starts by mounting your Google Drive to access the dataset stored there.
Loading Images: It defines a function load_images_from_folder to load images and labels from your dataset folder. The images are resized, converted to arrays, and normalized.
Data Augmentation: It uses ImageDataGenerator to augment the training data (creating variations of existing images) to potentially improve model performance.

2. Feature Extraction:

Gabor Filters: It applies Gabor filters to extract texture features from the images. These features capture patterns and edges.
Local Binary Patterns (LBP): LBP is used to extract local texture features, providing information about patterns in small image regions.
ResNet50: A pre-trained ResNet50 model is used to extract deep learning features. This leverages the knowledge learned by ResNet50 on a large dataset (ImageNet).
Feature Scaling: All extracted features are scaled using StandardScaler to bring them to a similar range, which can benefit model training.
Feature Concatenation: The Gabor, LBP, and ResNet50 features are combined into a single feature vector for each image.

3. Data Splitting:

Label Encoding: Image labels (e.g., "Osteoporosis", "Normal") are converted into numerical format using LabelEncoder.
Train-Test Split: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split to evaluate model performance.

4. Model Training and Evaluation:

SVM: A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is trained on the training data. Its accuracy and classification report are printed.
XGBoost: An XGBoost model is trained, and its performance is evaluated similarly to SVM.

5. Model Explainability:

SHAP: SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is used to understand the importance of different features in the XGBoost model's predictions.

6. Hyperparameter Tuning:

GridSearchCV (SVM): It uses GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for the SVM model, aiming to improve accuracy.
RandomizedSearchCV (XGBoost): Similarly, it tunes the hyperparameters of the XGBoost model using RandomizedSearchCV.

7. Testing:

Loading Sample Image: It loads a sample image for testing.
Feature Extraction (Sample): Features are extracted from the sample image using the same methods as before.
Prediction: The trained XGBoost model is used to predict the osteoporosis risk for the sample image.
Probability and Thresholding: The prediction probabilities are examined, and a threshold is applied to potentially improve the prediction.
Class Weighting: Finally, the XGBoost model is retrained with class weights to potentially handle imbalanced datasets.
